    "A cluster is a subset of data which are similar. Clustering (also called **unsupervised learning**) is the process of dividing a dataset into groups such that the members of each group are as similar (close) as possible to one another, and different groups are as dissimilar (far) as possible from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can uncover **previously undetected relationships** in a dataset. There are many applications for cluster analysis. For example, in business, cluster analysis can be used to discover and characterize customer segments for marketing purposes and in biology, it can be used for classification of plants and animals given their features.

    "\n",
    "1. Density-Based Methods :\n",
    "    - These methods consider the clusters as the dense region having some similarity and different from the lower dense region of the space. These methods have good accuracy and ability to merge two clusters.\n",
    "    - Example DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) , OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify Clustering Structure) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Based Methods :\n",
    "    - The clusters formed in this method forms a tree type structure based on the hierarchy. New clusters are formed using the previously formed one. It is divided into two category\n",
    "            -> Agglomerative (bottom up approach)\n",
    "            -> Divisive (top down approach)\n",
    "    - Examples CURE (Clustering Using Representatives), BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing Clustering and using Hierarchies) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Partitioning Methods :\n",
    "    - These methods partition the objects into k clusters and each partition forms one cluster. This method is used to optimize an objective criterion similarity function such as when the distance is a major parameter.\n",
    "    - Example: K-means, CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based upon randomized Search) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Grid-based Methods :\n",
    "    - In this method the data space are formulated into a finite number of cells that form a grid-like structure. All the clustering operation done on these grids are fast and independent of the number of data objects \n",
    "    - Example STING (Statistical Information Grid), wave cluster, CLIQUE (CLustering In Quest) etc."

    "An important issue in clustering is how to determine the similarity between two objects, so that clusters can be formed from objects with high similarity within clusters and low similarity between clusters. Commonly, to measure similarity or dissimilarity between objects, a distance measure such as Euclidean, Manhattan and Minkowski is used. A distance function returns a lower value for pairs of objects that are more similar to one another."
